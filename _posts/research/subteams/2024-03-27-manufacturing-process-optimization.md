## 1.1. Automatic Data Synchronization and Identification of Crucial Phases and Variables in the Ceramic Firing Process

**Students:** Yukun Xie

### Motivation
- The firing process for ceramic tiles is a MMP process with multiple sensors to monitor the temperature, pressure and equipment parameters. The data contains rich information​

- The streaming data collected from sensors are separated and not related to the quality characteristics of each product

### Objective
- Synchronize the continuous sensor data into product-oriented data and to conduct relationship mining in MMPs​

### Challenges
- Time delay​
- Missing sensors and multiple sensors at some stages​

### Proposal
- Automatic data synchronization to get the product-oriented mixed data​
- Model the relationship between the mixed data and quality characteristics ​
